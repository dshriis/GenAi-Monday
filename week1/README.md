## CSET419: Introduction to Generative AI

---

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to understand the fundamentals of **Generative AI** by generating synthetic data using a pre-trained generative model. Students will learn how to use Python-based tools to generate, store, and visualize synthetic data samples.

## Experiment 1: Implement a Simple Generative Algorithm for Data Generation

Generative AI models are capable of creating new and realistic data samples based on learned patterns. In this experiment, a **pre-trained generative model** is used to generate synthetic data samples, which are then stored in a structured dataset format for further analysis and use.

## Domain Selected

- **Image Data Generation**

---

## Generative Model Used

- **Stable Diffusion**  
  *(Pre-trained diffusion-based generative model)*

## Methodology / Procedure

1. Selected **image generation** as the data domain.  
2. Loaded a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion model** using Python.  
3. Provided multiple **textual input prompts** (minimum of 5) to guide the image generation process.  
4. Generated synthetic images using the generative model.  
5. Saved the generated images in a **folder-based dataset structure**.  
6. Displayed sample generated outputs for visual verification.
